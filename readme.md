# HTTP Endpoint Health Check Tool
## Overview
This Python program checks the health of a set of HTTP endpoints provided in a YAML configuration file. It sends requests every 15 seconds, determines the status of each endpoint, and logs the availability percentage of each domain over time.

## Features
Parses a YAML configuration file containing HTTP endpoints.
Sends requests at 15-second intervals.
Checks if the response status is within the 200â€“299 range and if the response latency is below 500 ms to determine if an endpoint is "UP".
Logs the cumulative availability percentage of each domain after every test cycle.
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries:

- requests
- PyYAML
Install them using:

`pip install requests pyyaml`

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository containing this script.
2. Prepare a YAML configuration file like the one provided in this repo named "input.yaml".
3. Run the script using the following command:
`python healthcheck.py`
4. Enter the path to the YAML configuration file when prompted.
